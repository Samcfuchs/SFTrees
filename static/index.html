        <h1>San Francisco Trees</h1>
        <p>
            Many of the trees in the San Francisco Trees dataset have the date
            of their planting recorded. For these trees, we can calculate almost
            exactly their age. This allows us to examine the relationship
            between tree age and size--essentially, the growth of trees over
            time. While the data is of course noisy (the size of a tree at its
            planting can vary wildly), we can clearly see a pattern when we
            examine the mean diameter for trees planted in each year. This
            visualization allows us to watch trees grow over time.

            The two diagrams in the right-hand column depict two subsets of the
            data. In the map on the top right, a map is drawn showing the
            locations of the largest trees around San Francisco. Many of these
            are recognizable as the outliers in the scatterplot on the left. By
            showing this plot, we gain a better understanding of those outliers
            and how they are distributed throughout the city.

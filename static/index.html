        <h1>San Francisco Trees</h1>
        <p>
            Many of the trees in the San Francisco Trees dataset have the date
            of their planting recorded. For these trees, we can calculate almost
            exactly their age. This allows us to examine the relationship
            between tree age and size--essentially, the growth of trees over
            time. While the data is of course noisy (the size of a tree at its
            planting can vary wildly), we can clearly see a pattern when we
            examine the mean diameter for trees planted in each year. This
            visualization allows us to watch trees grow over time.

            The two diagrams in the right-hand column depict two subsets of the
            data. In the map on the top right, a map is drawn showing the
            locations of the largest trees around San Francisco. Many of these
            are recognizable as the outliers in the scatterplot on the left. By
            showing this plot, we gain a better understanding of those outliers
            and how they are distributed throughout the city. We can imagine a
            San Francisco resident who looks at the plot on the left and
            immediately wonders at the fact that there are trees in the city
            that are nearly a meter in diameter. This plot would show them where
            those trees are, perhaps so they see them when they are nearby.
        </p>

            Finally, we show a detail view of the densest area of the
            scatterplot, below 25-30 cm. This is important because in the first
            visualization, the outliers make the pattern of trees growing with
            age difficult to parse immediately. In this innset pattern, we
            remove the subset of the data greater than some size_cutoff so that
            the plot lies entirely within the range of (0,25]. Additionally, I
            adjust the smoothing function applied to the average line so that
            the random variation from year to year is less pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to arrange these two detail plots on the right vertically so
            that they correspond visually with the data subsets they represent.
            I would like them to match the subset division line on the left
            exactly, but I find that such a division is too imbalanced, and thisi
            visual inbalance outweighs the slight visual load incurred by the
            audience in making sense of this separation.
